== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin works =

After installing and activate the plugin. Add the SNUP widget from the Widget menu. Create a new post. Write your text as normal. In the new field ("Show Next Upcoming Post") below the text field for the post you can add a teaser text. You add a featured image. Add a planned date for the posting, and press "Planned". This teaser text will not show up when the post is published.

= Now the plugin is in english. Can I change the language ? =

Sorry, there is no option in this version for specify a language. The language is set based on which language your Wordpress Installation uses. The plugin has English, Norwegian, Spanish and Dutch language files. If you would like another language, contact me and I can try to add it for you.

Ex. If your Wordpress is using English language the plugin will load the English language file. If your Wordpress is using Spanish language the plugin will load the Spanish language file. If your Wordpress is using a language that not has representet by its own language file, it will choose English as standard.
